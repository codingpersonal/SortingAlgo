Heap Sort 

Min heap - root is smaller than both children
Max heal - root is larger than both parents

If root is at r location in an array, 
left child = 2r + 1
right child = 2r + 2

Adding an element in the heap: Min Heap
Add an element in the end of the heap. Now the heap is disturbed.
Check the added element with its parent. If parent is smaller, then break.
If the parent is larger now, then swap it with parent.
Keep on doing it until either the parent is smaller
or root level is reached.

Deleting an element from the heap: Min Heap
Remove the root. Put it in some other array.
Now next root should be the smallest element.
So for now replace the last element in the array and make it as root.
Now heapify again.
Check roots children, if any1 is smaller, make it as root.
Keep on doing it until you reach the last leaf level.


Applications of heap:
If at any point of time, you need to store the top K numbers
You can do so using a Min Heap.
